360
00:17:26,676 --> 00:17:28,110
I THINK

361
00:17:28,178 --> 00:17:31,113
OH, YEAH?
I THINK IT'S PRONOUNCED BROKEN.

362
00:17:31,181 --> 00:17:33,275

00:17:46,296 --> 00:17:50,028
OH, GIRLS.
HERE'S YOUR MILK AND COOKIES.

368
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,194
[LAUGHTER]

369
00:17:54,537 --> 00:17:56,699
HEY, DUDES,
LET'S DITCH THIS JOINT.

WOULDN'T WANT TO BE YOU.

371
00:17:59,709 --> 00:18:01,575
OH, WHAT PRECIOUS ANGELS.

372
00:18:01,644 --> 00:18:05,376
SIR, THIS MIGHT JUST BE ME,
BUT DON'T YOU THINK

373
00:18:05,448 --> 00:18:06,574
THE GIRLS WERE ACTING
A LITTLE STRANGE?

374
00:18:06,649 --> 00:18:07,810
HOW SO?

375
00:18:07,884 --> 00:18:10,080
WELL, ROBBING THE BANK,
THE JEWELRY STORE,

376
00:18:10,153 --> 00:18:13,088
YOUR HOUSE, BEATING THE LIVING
DAYLIGHTS OUT OF YOU.

377
00:18:13,156 --> 00:18:14,317
NEED I GO ON?

378
00:18:14,391 --> 00:18:16,052
YES. I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

379
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:18,595
THE DEEP VOICES,
THE FACIAL HAIR, THE HEIGHT,

380
00:18:18,661 --> 00:18:20,356
NOT TO MENTION
THE MANLY ODOR.

381
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:21,363
AND? AND?

382
00:18:21,431 --> 00:18:22,865
THOSE WERE MEN

383
00:18:22,932 --> 00:18:24,991
DRESSED UP AS THE POWERPUFF GIRLS.
UNDERSTAND?

384
00:18:25,068 --> 00:18:27,435
YES! THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

385
00:18:27,504 --> 00:18:31,099
HELLO, CHIEF OF POLICE?
ARREST THE POWERPUFF GIRLS.

386
00:18:31,174 --> 00:18:32,300
OH!

387
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:34,343
NARRATOR: UH-OH. THIS
ISN'T LOOKING TOO GOOD.

388
00:18:34,411 --> 00:18:36,106
AND BY ADDING YOUR PENNIES
TO THIS JAR,

389
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:37,613
WE CAN FEED
THE HOMELESS,

390
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,614
HELP ABUSED ANIMALS
FIND GOOD HOMES,

391
00:18:39,682 --> 00:18:42,481
OR ADOPT A CHILD
FROM A THIRD-WORLD COUNTRY.

392
00:18:42,552 --> 00:18:43,383
MAN:
FREEZE!

393
00:18:48,591 --> 00:18:50,491
POWERPUFF GIRLS,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

394
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,455
NARRATOR:
POWERPUFFS IMPRISONED?

395
00:18:55,532 --> 00:18:56,465
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

396
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:58,558
WHY DID THEY THROW US
IN THE SLAMMER?

397
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:00,069
SOMETHING'S
GOING ON,

398
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:01,570
AND I DON'T LIKE
THIS ONE BIT.

399
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:03,003
AND THE WORST
THING IS,

400
00:19:03,073 --> 00:19:07,237
WE WON'T GET TO SAVE
THE WORLD ANYMORE.

401
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,336
WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP,
CRYBABY?

402
00:19:10,413 --> 00:19:12,745
NOW THAT'S NO WAY TO TALK
TO YOUR SISTER.

403
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:14,580
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.
SHUT UP.

404
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,517
NO, YOU SHUT UP.

405
00:19:16,586 --> 00:19:19,351
WHY DON'T YOU ALL SHUT UP?
YOU'VE GOT A VISITOR.

406
00:19:21,658 --> 00:19:23,023
GIRLS:
MISS BELLUM!

407
00:19:23,093 --> 00:19:25,084
BOY, ARE WE GLAD
TO SEE YOU!

408
00:19:25,161 --> 00:19:26,754
AND WHATEVER IT IS,
WE DIDN'T DO IT.

409
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,095
I KNOW, GIRLS, BUT I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT BELIEVES YOU.

410
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:32,601
3 EVIL MEN HAVE BEEN
DRESSING UP LIKE YOU.

411
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:35,104
THEY ROBBED A BANK,
STOLE PRECIOUS JEWELRY,

412
00:19:35,171 --> 00:19:37,139
AND HARASSED THE MAYOR
IN HIS OWN HOME.

413
00:19:37,207 --> 00:19:38,606
WHO COULD BE DOING THIS?

414
00:19:38,675 --> 00:19:40,609
ROBBING THE BANK,
STEALING PRECIOUS JEWELRY,

415
00:19:40,677 --> 00:19:42,611
HARASSING THE MAYOR
IN HIS OWN HOME.

416
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:44,238
ANYTHING ELSE,
MISS BELLUM?

417
00:19:44,314 --> 00:19:47,113
MISS BELLUM:
WELL, THERE IS SOMETHING ELSE.

418
00:19:47,183 --> 00:19:49,413
HE--HE CALLED ME
SWEET CHEEKS.

419
00:19:49,486 --> 00:19:50,419
GIRLS:
NO!

420
00:19:50,487 --> 00:19:52,046
NARRATOR:
NOT SWEET CHEEKS!

421
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,147
HAND IT OVER,
SWEET CHEEKS.

422
00:19:54,224 --> 00:19:56,522
THAT'S IT.
I KNOW WHO THEY ARE.

423
00:19:56,593 --> 00:19:59,028
THEY ARE THE ONLY 3 VILLAINS

424
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:00,529
CAPABLE OF SUCH INSENSITIVE,

425
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:01,530
DEROGATORY,

426
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:02,963
AND INSULTING LANGUAGE.

427
00:20:03,032 --> 00:20:05,797
DON'T WORRY, MISS BELLUM.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

428
00:20:05,869 --> 00:20:08,133
COME ON, GIRLS.
LET'S BUST OUT OF THIS JOINT.

429
00:20:08,204 --> 00:20:10,639
WAIT! WE CAN'T
ESCAPE FROM PRISON.

430
00:20:10,707 --> 00:20:12,141
THAT WOULD BE
BREAKING THE LAW.

431
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:13,642
NOT AGAIN.

432
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:15,644
REGARDLESS OF OUR DUTIES
TO SAVE THE WORLD,

433
00:20:15,712 --> 00:20:19,649
WE WOULD BE FURTHER HARMING
OUR FALSELY SOILED REPUTATIONS--

434
00:20:19,716 --> 00:20:21,650
HEY! WAIT FOR ME!

435
00:20:21,718 --> 00:20:24,653
NARRATOR: HA HA! NOW,
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

436
00:20:24,721 --> 00:20:26,382
YOU GO, GIRLS.

437
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,217
BOY, I'M STARVING.

438
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:35,664
NOT SO FAST,
POWERPUFF GIRLS!

439
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:38,702
POWERPUFF GIRLS?
BRING IT ON!

440
00:20:44,207 --> 00:20:45,675
HOY-YAH!

441
00:20:45,742 --> 00:20:48,177
OW!

442
00:20:48,244 --> 00:20:49,837

OOPS. SORRY.

447
00:20:58,288 --> 00:21:01,258
WAIT A SECOND.
THIS ISN'T WORKING, GUYS.

448
00:21:01,324 --> 00:21:03,122
LET'S JUST FIGHT
OUR COUNTERPARTS, OK?

449
00:21:03,193 --> 00:21:04,490
ALL.
O.

450
00:21:04,561 --> 00:21:06,689
READY?
0K? GO!

451
00:21:19,175 --> 00:21:21,269
OH! AAH! PLEASE!

452
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:38,661
OH, I KNEW
YOU WERE INNOCENT THE WHOLE TIME.

453
00:21:38,728 --> 00:21:40,389
NARRATOR:
YEAH, RIGHT.

454
00:21:40,463 --> 00:21:43,660
AND THANK YOU ONCE AGAIN
FOR SAVING TOWNSVILLE.

455
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,327
OF COURSE, NOW YOU'LL HAVE TO
GO BACK TO JAIL

456
00:21:46,402 --> 00:21:49,030
FOR BREAKING OUT

457
00:21:49,105 --> 00:21:51,073
[ALL LAUGHING]

458
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:53,801
